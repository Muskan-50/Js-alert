# Js-alert
 This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript's built-in alert() function. It displays a message box to the user when the web page loads or when a specific event occurs. The alert is used to provide notifications, greetings, or basic debugging messages.
 
# Disadvantages
alert() is synchronous.
when alert pops up javaScript execution pauses until the user closes it.
This can interruppt, animations, timers etc.

# Summary
alert() is easy to use for quick debugging, but for production apps, it’s poor UX, blocking, unstyled, and not accessible. Modern apps use modals, toasts, or inline messages instead.
